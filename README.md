A raspberry Pi project for constructing a mechanical power meter using low cost elements:
a) a hall effect sensor for measuring the angular speed of the wheel
b) a load cell for measuring the force on the pedal
c) a Python sotware that calculates the power as the multiplication of the force in Newtons by the angular speed in radians per second
d) a TFT screen for displaying the results
